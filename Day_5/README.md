## 🌸 Iris Dataset Analysis  
**Internship Task – Elevate Labs**

This notebook presents a complete analysis of the **Iris dataset** as part of my data analytics internship at **Elevate Labs**. The project showcases my ability to perform data preprocessing, visualization, classification, and clustering using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

### 📌 Highlights of My Work

#### 📊 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed dataset structure and summary statistics  
- Explored class distribution and feature correlations  
- Created pair plots, box plots, and heatmaps using Seaborn and Matplotlib  

#### 🧹 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Verified and handled missing values  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Scaled features (optional, based on model)  

#### 🤖 3. **Supervised Learning (Classification)**
Implemented and compared the performance of:  
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

➡️ Evaluated each model using **accuracy score** and **confusion matrix**  
➡️ Achieved up to **97% accuracy**

#### 🔍 4. **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)**
- Applied **K-Means Clustering**  
- Used **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** for optimal cluster count  
- Compared cluster results with actual species labels
